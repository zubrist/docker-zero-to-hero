# ðŸ“˜ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Student Management System â€” Module 1: Student Functionality

### 1. Introduction
This document outlines the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Module 1 of the Student Management System, focusing on functionalities for **student users**. This is a web-based application built using:

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **File Storage:** Files stored in directories, with paths saved in the database

### 2. Purpose
The purpose of this module is to provide students with a platform where they can:
- Register and manage their profiles
- Log in securely
- Upload necessary academic documents
- Search and access their data securely

### 3. Scope
This module includes only the student user functionality. Other user types (Professors, Office Staffs, Admins) will be developed in future modules.

### 4. Functional Requirements (FR)

| ID     | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| FR1    | Student shall be able to register using basic details (name, email, phone, password, department, roll number). |
| FR2    | Registration status shall initially be set to 'Pending'. Admin shall review the registration and set it to either 'Temporarily Registered' or 'Registration Complete'. |
| FR3    | Student shall be able to log in using email and password, but access to functionalities will depend on registration status. |
| FR4    | System shall validate credentials with hashed passwords stored in the database. |
| FR5    | Student shall be able to view and edit their profile. |
| FR6    | Student shall be able to upload academic documents (PDFs, JPGs, PNGs), based on their registration status. |
| FR7    | The system shall store uploaded files in a directory and save paths in the database. |
| FR8    | Student shall be able to search their data by keywords (e.g., course name, document type), if fully registered. |
| FR9    | Student shall receive feedback (e.g., confirmation or error messages) after each operation. |

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
- **Security:** Passwords stored using hashing algorithms.
- **Performance:** Must support concurrent access by multiple students.
- **Usability:** UI must be user-friendly and responsive.
- **Reliability:** System should recover from database or service failures gracefully.
- **Scalability:** Designed to support additional modules for other user roles.

#### ðŸ“œ Sequence Diagram â€” Student Registration
```plaintext
Student -> React Frontend: Fill registration form
React Frontend -> FastAPI Backend: POST /register
FastAPI Backend -> MySQL: INSERT INTO students (status = 'Pending')
MySQL -> FastAPI Backend: Success/Failure
FastAPI Backend -> React Frontend: Registration submitted
React Frontend -> Student: Show success
Admin -> Admin Panel: Review new registrations
Admin -> FastAPI Backend: Approve or Reject Registration
FastAPI Backend -> MySQL: UPDATE students SET status = 'Temporary' or 'Complete'
```

#### ðŸ“œ Sequence Diagram â€” Upload Document
```plaintext
Student -> React Frontend: Choose file to upload
React Frontend -> FastAPI Backend: POST /upload-doc
FastAPI Backend -> Check registration status
FastAPI Backend -> Filesystem: Save file (only if status is Temporary or Complete)
FastAPI Backend -> MySQL: INSERT INTO documents (path, title, student_id)
MySQL -> FastAPI Backend: Success
FastAPI Backend -> React Frontend: File uploaded successfully / denied
```
