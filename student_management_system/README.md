Important notes:

The Gateway service needs to be configured to proxy requests to the Students service
Each service can be scaled independently
The MySQL data will persist across container restarts
Services can communicate using their service names as hostnames
Environment variables can be customized in the .env file
Would you like me to:

Add more services to the composition?
Add additional configuration for any service?
Implement the Gateway service proxy configuration?
Add development/production environment separation?
